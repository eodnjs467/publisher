		<h3>Real-Time Starbucks Updates in Times Square</h3>

		<p class="img_txt">Times Square has been long deserving of a Starbucks that blends 
        in with the 
        bright lights, non-stop activity and unique buzz of the neighborhood. We’re really 
        excited to announce that last month we opened a new store at the corner of 47th and
        Broadway. It is designed to look and feel like one of the nearby Broadway 
        Theaters.</p>

		<p class="img_txt">Design has always inspired us, ever since we first opened our 
        doors in Pike Place 
        Market 40 years ago. Since then, our coffee and our culture have progressed with the 
        times, and our evolved Siren has made its way into neighborhoods all across the 
        world ? making its most recent design debut this year.</p>

		<p class="img_txt">As a frequent collaborator with the design and artist community, 
        we are proud 
        to team up with and contribute to the CFDA/VOGUE FASHION FUND (CVFF), an 
        esteemed organization that gives annual grants that provide resources to support and 
        encourage the goals of emerging American fashion designers. Alongside the CVFF, we 
        were thrilled to invite the past three winners, Alexander Wang (2008), Sophie Theallet 
        (2009) and Billy Reid (2010) to create signature, limited-edition designer T-shirts 
        inspired by Starbucks and their personal experience with our brand and our coffee 
        over the years.</p>
