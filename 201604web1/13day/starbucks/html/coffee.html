    	<h3>Brewin’ Up Something Special From Hawaii</h3>

		<h4>Wednesday, October 05, 2011<br/>
		Posted by Leslie W., senior green coffee specialist</h4>

		<p id="coffee1">A new coffee is arriving for Starbucks Reserve and we are 
        delighted to share 
        it with you. Ka’u coffee takes its name from the Ka’u district on the Big Island of 
        Hawaii. The Ka’u region is located on the slopes of the volcano Mauna Loa. The 
        area was traditionally used for growing sugar cane, but after the exodus of sugar 
        plantations the soil was well-suited to grow coffee. With over 2,000 acres of prime 
        land in the district of Ka’u there are approximately 280 acres planted and worked 
        by about 40 farmers. Here Ka’u coffee is quietly transforming this small region 
        into a world-class coffee source that’s gaining attention.</p>

		<h3>Help Us Support Education in Your Community</h3>

		<h4>Friday, September 23, 2011<br/>

		<p id="coffee2">Recent reports tell us that a quarter of U.S. students do not 
        graduate from 
        high school on time. For young people of color, this number is close to 40 percent.
        <br/><br/>
		Sadly, it is not news that fewer and fewer of us in the U.S. successfully graduate. 
        Nor is it news that America’s educational system must better address the 21st 
        century needs of our citizens. It’s a huge task that no single entity can change.
		<br/><br/>
		Starbucks is committed to being a catalyst for change by leveraging our stores, 
        our partners and the connection we have with our customers. Through our Youth 
        Action Grants, we’ve supported young people in the U.S. and around the world in 
        taking action to address needs in their local communities. We’ve mobilized 
        thousands of Starbucks partners and customers to make a difference by doing 
        community service to improve their local schools and revitalize local parks.</p>
