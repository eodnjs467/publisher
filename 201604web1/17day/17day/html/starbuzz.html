    	<h2>QUALITY COFFEE, QUALITY CAFFEINE</h2>

		<p>At Starbuzz Coffee, we are dedicated to filling all your caffeine needs 
        through our quality coffees and teas. Sure, we want you to have a great cup of 
        coffee and a great coffee experience as well, but we're the only company that 
        actively monitors and optimizes caffeine levels. So stop by and fill your cup, or 
        order online with our new Bean Machine online order form, and get that quality 
        Starbuzz coffee that you know will meet your caffeine standards. </p>

		<p>And, did we mention caffeine? We've just started funding the guys doing 
        all the wonderful research at the Caffeine Buzz. If you want the latest on 
        coffee and other caffeine products, stop by and pay them a visit.</p>

		<h2>OUR STORY</h2>

		<p>"A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, 
        but it resulted in a damn good cup of coffee. Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and 
        you already know his plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.</p>

		<p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today you can enjoy 
        Starbuzz just about anywhere. And, of course, the big news this year is that 
        Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz's Web presence, 
        which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole 
        new set of customers. </p>

		<h2>STARBUZZ COFFEE BEVERAGES</h2>

		<p>We've got a variety of caffeinated beverages to choose from at Starbuzz, 
        including our House Blend, Mocha Cafe Latte, Cappuccino, and a favorite of our 
        customers, Chai Tea.</p>

		<p>We also offer a variety of coffee beans, whole or ground, for you to take 
        home with you. Order your coffee today using our online Bean Machine, and 
        take the Starbuzz Coffee experience home.</p>
