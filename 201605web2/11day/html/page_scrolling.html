			<h3>Introducing Starbucks® Blonde Roast</h3>
			<h4>Tuesday, October 18, 2011<br/>
			Posted by Dub H., senior vice president, coffee</h4>

			<p>Today marks an exciting day as we announce the newest addition to our 
         Starbucks Roast Spectrum ? Starbucks® Blonde Roast. This roast builds on our 
         experience ? over 40 years ? in artisanal roasting and sourcing to bring you a truly 
         lighter-bodied coffee. Starbucks® Blonde Roast joins our current lineup that 
         includes medium and dark roasts giving you a spectrum of options and making it 
         easier for you to find your favorite coffee.</p>

			<p>We explored more than 80 recipes before we selected the final coffees for 
         Starbucks® Blonde Roast. The new coffees included in this category are Starbucks 
         Veranda Blend™, Starbucks Willow Blend™, Decaf Starbucks Willow Blend™ and 
         Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew Veranda Blend™.</p>

 			<h3>Brewin’ Up Something Special From Hawaii</h3>
			<h4>Wednesday, October 05, 2011<br/>
			Posted by Leslie W., senior green coffee specialist</h4>

			<p>A new coffee is arriving for Starbucks Reserve and we are delighted to share it 
         with you. Ka’u coffee takes its name from the Ka’u district on the Big Island of 
         Hawaii. The Ka’u region is located on the slopes of the volcano Mauna Loa. The 
         area was traditionally used for growing sugar cane, but after the exodus of sugar 
         plantations the soil was well-suited to grow coffee. With over 2,000 acres of prime 
         land in the district of Ka’u there are approximately 280 acres planted and worked by
         about 40 farmers. Here Ka’u coffee is quietly transforming this small region into a 
         world-class coffee source that’s gaining attention.</p>

			<h3>Help Us Support Education in Your Community</h3>
			<h4>Friday, September 23, 2011<br/>
         Posted by Rodney H. ? Community Investments director</h4>

			<p>Recent reports tell us that a quarter of U.S. students do not graduate from high
         school on time. For young people of color, this number is close to 40 percent.</p>

			<p>Sadly, it is not news that fewer and fewer of us in the U.S. successfully 
         graduate. Nor is it news that America’s educational system must better address the 
         21st century needs of our citizens. It’s a huge task that no single entity can 
         change.</p>

			<p>Starbucks is committed to being a catalyst for change by leveraging our stores, 
         our partners and the connection we have with our customers. Through our Youth 
         Action Grants, we’ve supported young people in the U.S. and around the world in 
         taking action to address needs in their local communities. We’ve mobilized 
         thousands of Starbucks partners and customers to make a difference by doing 
         community service to improve their local schools and revitalize local parks.</p>

			<h3>Real-Time Starbucks Updates in Times Square</h3>
			<p>Monday, October 10, 2011<br/>
			Posted by Brad N. - Global Digital Marketing product manager</p>

			<p>Times Square has been long deserving of a Starbucks that blends in with the 
         bright lights, non-stop activity and unique buzz of the neighborhood. We’re really 
         excited to announce that last month we opened a new store at the corner of 47th 
         and Broadway. It is designed to look and feel like one of the nearby Broadway 
         Theaters.</p>

			<p>Design has always inspired us, ever since we first opened our doors in Pike 
         Place Market 40 years ago. Since then, our coffee and our culture have progressed 
         with the times, and our evolved Siren has made its way into neighborhoods all 
         across the world ? making its most recent design debut this year.</p>

			<p>As a frequent collaborator with the design and artist community, we are proud 
         to team up with and contribute to the CFDA/VOGUE FASHION FUND (CVFF), an 
         esteemed organization that gives annual grants that provide resources to support 
         and encourage the goals of emerging American fashion designers. Alongside the 
         CVFF, we were thrilled to invite the past three winners, Alexander Wang (2008), 
         Sophie Theallet (2009) and Billy Reid (2010) to create signature, limited-edition 
         designer T-shirts inspired by Starbucks and their personal experience with our brand
         and our coffee over the years.</p>
